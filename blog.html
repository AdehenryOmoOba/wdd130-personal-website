            "Cloud computing" plays a vital role in the creation of software products and services. It's also one of the most highly sought-after skills in the tech industry. In fact, most of the projects on this site will require cloud interaction of some sort‚Äîparticularly with AWS's serverless products.

            I was recently granted access to the OpenAI GPT-3 Beta, a very powerful language model that can be used to do all sorts of magic like chat bot generation, article summary, and a lot more cool stuff. But the application that really excited me was creative writing (stuff like SEO generation is cool and all, but a also a bit dry for my taste).

          <p>Building a QR Code Micro App</p>
         </div>
         <div class="content">
          <p>
            Ever since the pandemic started, I've noticed QR codes creeping into my daily life. Venue check-ins, digital menus at restaurants, and online payments. I thought it'd be fun to explore the technology a little bit, so I've built a micro web-app that lets you save messages and view them later using a QR code. Sort of a "Hello World" QR code project. In this post, I'll be sharing how I built this using Python and AWS free tier. You can try out the app itself here. The source code is also available on GitHub.

          <p>Create a Retro Game With PICO-8</p>
         </div>
         <div class="content">
          <p>
            After watching High Score on Netflix, I was suddenly inspired to develop a retro-style game. I think it was a combination of the aesthetics and nostalgia that motivated me. It turned out to be a pretty fun experience, and something I'd recommend as a weekend project to any developer. With tools like PICO-8 (a NES-like virtual console), it's really easy to get started ‚Äî even if you're a beginner to programming. In this post, I'll be discussing why you should try your hand at retro-game development, and explain some of the technical limitations you'll be facing.
